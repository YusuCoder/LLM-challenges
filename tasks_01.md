# Learning Path: PyTorch LLM Challenges

## Challenge 0: The Attention Detective üïµÔ∏è
**Level:** Beginner  
**XP:** 100  
**Time Limit:** 3 days

**Mission:** Your friend asks: "What does attention mean in AI?" Help them understand by showing, not just telling.

**Deliverables:**
- Create a simple visualization showing how attention works
- Use any existing library (bertviz, attention-visualization tools)
- Test it on 3 simple sentences
- Write a 1-page explanation for a non-technical friend

**Getting Started:**
- Try Hugging Face's bertviz library
- Start with GPT-2 (it's smaller and easier to work with)
- Focus on one attention head first

**Success Criteria:** Can your non-technical friend understand your explanation?

## Challenge 1: The Evolution Hunter ü¶ñ
**Level:** Beginner  
**XP:** 150  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 0

**Mission:** Create a "family tree" of GPT models to understand how they evolved.

**Deliverables:**
- Simple timeline showing GPT-1 ‚Üí GPT-2 ‚Üí GPT-3 ‚Üí GPT-4
- Table comparing their sizes (parameters) and capabilities
- One-page summary: "What changed and why it matters"

**Resources to Start:**
- OpenAI blog posts about each model
- Wikipedia pages for quick facts
- Papers With Code for model comparisons

**Simplified Requirements:**
- Focus on 4-5 models only
- Use any visualization tool (even PowerPoint!)
- Rough estimates are fine for costs

**Bonus XP:** Find and explain one surprising fact about model growth

## Challenge 2: The Code Whisperer üó£Ô∏è
**Level:** Intermediate  
**XP:** 200  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 1

**Mission:** Explore how and why GPT models can write code.

**Deliverables:**
- Test 5 simple coding tasks with GPT (use ChatGPT or similar)
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Create a "GPT Coding Cheat Sheet" for your classmates

**Example Tasks to Try:**
- Write a "Hello World" in 3 languages
- Fix a simple bug in provided code
- Explain what a piece of code does
- Convert code from one language to another

**Simplified Approach:**
- Use free tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Start with very simple examples
- It's okay if some things don't work!

**Success Metric:** Help a classmate use GPT for their coding homework

## Challenge 3: The Prompt Engineer üèóÔ∏è
**Level:** Intermediate  
**XP:** 250  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 2

**Mission:** Learn the art of prompt engineering to make AI assistants more helpful.

**Deliverables:**
- Collection of 10 prompt templates that work well
- Before/after examples showing improvement
- Simple prompt testing notebook

**Areas to Explore:**
- Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Role-playing prompts
- Structured output formats

**Simplified Tools:**
- Use any available AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Jupyter notebook or Google Colab
- Focus on prompts, not code

**Peer Activity:** Share prompts and test each other's templates

## Challenge 4: The Size Detective üìà
**Level:** Advanced  
**XP:** 300  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 3

**Mission:** Investigate: "Does bigger always mean better?"

**Deliverables:**
- Compare 3 models of different sizes on same tasks
- Graph showing performance vs model size
- Answer: When is a smaller model actually better?

**Suggested Comparisons:**
- GPT-2 vs GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
- Or: Llama models of different sizes
- Test on: Math, coding, creative writing, factual questions

**Tools You Can Use:**
- Hugging Face model hub
- Free API credits from various providers
- Simple Python scripts for testing

**Discussion Topic:** What are the trade-offs of model size?

## Challenge 5: The AI Teacher üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
**Level:** Expert  
**XP:** 500  
**Prerequisites:** All previous challenges

**Mission:** Create a learning resource that helps others understand LLMs.

**Deliverables:**
- Choose: Tutorial, video, interactive demo, or workshop
- Must explain one concept from Challenges 0-4 in depth
- Include hands-on exercises for learners

**Example Projects:**
- "Attention Explained in 5 Minutes" video
- Interactive prompt engineering playground
- "Build Your First AI App" workshop
- Visual guide to model sizes and capabilities

**Quality Criteria:**
- Can a complete beginner follow along?
- Do learners actually understand after using it?
- Is it more helpful than existing resources?

**Final Step:** Teach it to next semester's students!

## Peer Learning Mechanics

### Daily Check-ins (Optional)
- What did you learn yesterday?
- What are you stuck on?
- Who can you help today?

### Peer Support
- **Buddy System:** Pair up with someone at your level
- **Help Channel:** Slack/Discord for questions
- **No stupid questions:** Everything is a learning opportunity

### Weekly Show & Tell
