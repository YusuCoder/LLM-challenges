## What changed and why it matters

The GPT model family has rapidly envolved since 2018. Each new version of the model inroduced more paramenters, better understanding of context, and broder capabilities.

* GPT-1 showed that transformer models could generate human-like text.
* GPT-2 scaled that idea up, producing surprisingly coherent long-form content.
* GPT-3 made a leap in scale and became useful for real-world applications like chatbots, coding help, and summarization-all with very little fine-tuning.
* GPT-4 focused on quality, not just size. It reduced hallucinations, improved factual accuracy, and introduced multimodal inputs, enabling the model to see images as well as read text.

## Why it matters:
This progression shows that both scale and architecture changes contribute to more powerful AI, But bigger isn't always better-refinements in training methods and safety tools have become just as important.



## SURPRISING FACT ABOUT MODEL GROWTH:
* GPT-2 was so good, OpenAI initially refused to release it publicly! 
They feared it might be used to generate fake news or spam, this sparked a big debate about AI safety and responsible disclosure.
