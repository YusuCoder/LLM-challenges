## Challenge 1: The Evolution Hunter ðŸ¦–
**Level:** Beginner  
**XP:** 150  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 0

**Mission:** Create a "family tree" of GPT models to understand how they evolved.

**Deliverables:**
- Simple timeline showing GPT-1 â†’ GPT-2 â†’ GPT-3 â†’ GPT-4
- Table comparing their sizes (parameters) and capabilities
- One-page summary: "What changed and why it matters"

**Resources to Start:**
- OpenAI blog posts about each model
- Wikipedia pages for quick facts
- Papers With Code for model comparisons

**Simplified Requirements:**
- Focus on 4-5 models only
- Use any visualization tool (even PowerPoint!)
- Rough estimates are fine for costs

**Bonus XP:** Find and explain one surprising fact about model growth
