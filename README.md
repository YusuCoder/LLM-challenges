# LLM Challenges

Welcome to the LLM Challenges repository! This project is designed to help learners explore and understand large language models (LLMs) through a series of engaging challenges. Each challenge is structured to build knowledge progressively, from basic concepts to more advanced applications.

## Project Overview

The LLM Challenges consist of a series of tasks that guide users through various aspects of LLMs, including attention mechanisms, model evolution, coding capabilities, prompt engineering, and more. Each challenge is categorized by difficulty level and includes experience points (XP) as a fun way to track progress.

## Files Included

- **tasks_01.md**: This file contains detailed descriptions of each challenge, including their levels, XP rewards, prerequisites, missions, deliverables, resources, and success criteria.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LLM Challenges:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `tasks_01.md` file to view the challenges.
3. Follow the instructions for each challenge and complete them at your own pace.
